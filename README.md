# the-ring-2.0
My attempt to create the online Magic The Gathering game.

If you'd like to know more about it, I invite to you to watch the YouTube presentation:

It's an updated version of https://github.com/agawrysiuk/mtgring-client

The older version was a bit of a coding mess, so this update is meant to structure everything
according to Robert C. Martin's "Clean Code".

It's an ongoing work and will be finished when this line gets removed :)

## Project statistics (original)

**Work time**: 2 months

**Lines of code**: 6,300

**External libraries used**:
- javafx
- json
- jsoup
- imgscalr

**Client-side and server-side**

**Universal card import for the future sets**

**With its own card database**

Additional information: all trademarks, MTG Arena software and images are the property of Wizards of the Coast LLC or its parent Company, Hasbro, Inc. Thus, I left out the server version of this application and will not add it, as I don't want to distribute it.

It's only an example of my 2-month work. I hope you enjoyed the video linked above :)
