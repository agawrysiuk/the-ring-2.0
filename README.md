# the-ring-2.0
My attempt to create the online Magic The Gathering game.

If you'd like to know more about it, I invite to you to watch the YouTube presentation:

It's an updated version of https://github.com/agawrysiuk/mtgring-client

The older version was a bit of a coding mess, so this update is meant to structure everything
according to Robert C. Martin's "Clean Code".

Additionally, I am going to make a list of changes that will be developed to this project.

It's an ongoing work and will be finished when this line gets removed :)

## TODO

- Clean the code
- Change the play from Standard to Commander
- Stick to the fixed number of decks
- Add the database
- Change UI

## Notes
- App.java files in both Client and Downloader are required to start JavaFX from IntelliJ/Maven packs
(a workaround for a known bug)
